I need help creating the best Baltimore smart city web dashboard that was every created using the TruContext framework from Visium Technologies.

This dashboard will be serverless so it can be hosted locally and synced with GitHub to be hosted on Vercel.

Please use the best framework (React, Vue, Svelte, Vite, etc.) to show the wow factor with transitions, animation, flashy look, wow factor, etc. 

Create a very nice landing page with a default admin login that is pre-filled to login.  This will be the first page used to impress everyone for the Baltimore demo tomorrow.  I will provide the b-roll video to play in the background of the landing page.

Use the CSV data files in the docs folder as a template to create mock smart city alarms that are available throughout the dashboard and generated in a cloud PostgreSQL database, credentials are provided and should be stored in the .env file; postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_HhWCxR57MGis@ep-wandering-hall-a46blaei-pooler.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require7

Have a section dedicated to the Ubicell UGU devices with graphical diagrams of the devices and setup.

Design the colors of the dashboard around Baltimore's city colors, logo, symbols, etc..

• While residents and local culture also associate colors such as orange (Orioles), purple (Ravens), and brick red (row homes), these are not the codified city colors or symbols.reddit​
Baltimore thus officially identifies with black and gold, as reflected in both city flag and seal, with the Battle Monument as the central emblem.wikipedia+2​

Vite remains a leading build tool and development environment for creating rich, interactive dashboards in 2025, especially when paired with frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte. However, it's not strictly a "framework"—rather, Vite is a fast, extensible build system, often chosen for its blazing development performance and flexibility. For sophisticated, animated, and professional dashboards (such as those required for smart city applications), React, Svelte, and Next.js are also top contenders depending on scale, rendering requirements, and team structure.strapi+4​
Vite: Strengths and Limitations
	• Vite offers sub-second startup times, instant HMR (Hot Module Replacement), and maximum control over your project's stack.codeparrot+1​
	• It is framework-agnostic, supporting React, Vue, Svelte, etc., and excels in developer velocity for Single Page Applications (SPAs) with custom animations and transitions.netguru+1​
	• Default client-side rendering means super-fast local development, but SEO or SSR (Server-Side Rendering) needs require manual setup.strapi​
	• While Vite can deliver high performance with animations (using React's new View Transitions API, Svelte's compiler optimizations, or lightweight libraries), some features like automatic image optimization or built-in SSR found in Next.js are missing by default.logrocket+2​
Modern JS Frameworks for Dashboards
	• React: Industry standard for interactive dashboards; huge ecosystem for visualizations (e.g., Recharts, D3.js) and animation libraries.softwarehouse+2​
	• Next.js: Built on React but adds out-of-the-box SSR/SSG, API routes, and image optimization; better for SEO or multi-user dashboards with advanced routing.debutinfotech+1​
	• Svelte: Compiles to lightweight JS with minimal runtime, ideal for ultra-fast, resource-efficient dashboards and heavy animation work.esparkinfo+1​
	• Angular & Vue: Popular for enterprise-scale platforms, heavily optimized for performance, advanced routing and UI transitions, and large teams.dev+1​
Animations and Transitions
	• Modern frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte) support sophisticated animation APIs and libraries (Framer Motion, React Spring, GSAP, native View Transitions).softwarehouse+1​
	• Rich animations are straightforward with Vite, as long as you use one of these frameworks and relevant visualization/animation libraries.codeparrot+1​
Choosing the Best Stack for Smart City Dashboards
	• For maximum developer speed, flexibility, and modern UI libraries, Vite with React or Svelte is hard to beat, especially for highly custom dashboards with rich animations.netguru+2​
	• For heavy SEO needs, built-in SSR, or rapid API prototyping with unified deployments, Next.js is preferred by larger teams.debutinfotech+1​
	• The choice ultimately depends on your team's backend setup, deployment model, and the importance of SEO, SSR, and out-of-the-box optimizations.
Conclusion
Vite is still among the best choices for building complex, interactive dashboards with rich transitions and animations—when combined with a major JS framework like React or Svelte—but it is no longer the only top-tier solution, as Next.js and Svelte offer compelling alternatives depending on your needs. It's ideal for fast development, micro-frontends, and SaaS dashboards requiring custom UI/UX and real-time updates, but consider Next.js or Svelte for additional features or performanceor performance goals.prerender+3​

Varying results on my end based on the AI tool used - here's what Co-Pilot gave me:
 
Dataset enhancement plan and ready-to-run script
I could not access the prior CSV from this environment, so I prepared a ready-to-run Python script you can run locally. It will:
	· Append Latitude and Longitude for each incident using a Baltimore bounding box (lat 39.25–39.35, lon -76.75–-76.55)
	· Add a numeric Resolution_Time in hours for incidents with Resolution_Status == "Resolved" (random float 1.0–72.0)
	· Save an updated CSV
	· Compute KPIs: Average Resolution Time (hours), counts by Severity, counts by Resolution_Status Run the script in the same folder as your CSV (name the input file as shown or update the filename variable).

To use Ubicquia Ubicell UGU devices for capturing real data in the TruContext application, you need to follow a multi-step process that involves proper installation, connectivity setup, and integration with TruContext's data source system.[1][2]

### Device Installation

- Install the Ubicell UGU as per the instructions inside the box:
  - Push the device down onto the NEMA socket.[3]
  - Turn it 15 degrees to lock it in place.
  - Pull straight up on the device to check that it is securely installed; repeat if loose.
- Verify that the NEMA connector does not rotate during installation.[3]
- Ensure the Ubicell is firmly attached, with the connector parallel to the socket and the clamp secured.[3]
- Optional: Install a photocell if required, making sure something always remains installed in the NEMA socket.[3]

### Getting Data from Ubicell

- Ubicell controllers gather streetlight diagnostics, energy data, and environmental metrics.
- These devices communicate wirelessly, typically over LTE, to Ubicquia’s cloud platform (UbiVu).[4]
- You must configure your Ubicell device with network credentials for cloud connectivity, often handled during device onboarding.[1]

### Sending Real Data to TruContext

- TruContext's Data Source system allows you to fetch data dynamically from cloud services using HTTP GET requests or integrations like Amazon S3, ServiceNow, SharePoint, or direct API connections.[2]
- For Ubicquia Ubicell integration:
  - Ensure Ubicell data is routed to a cloud storage or data management platform supported by TruContext (common formats: CSV, XML, JSON).
  - Set up a TrueContext Data Source to fetch the Ubicell metrics using the appropriate API or direct GET request URL from Ubicquia’s UbiVu platform.[2]
- In the TrueContext portal:
  - Go to Forms & Integrations > Data Sources.
  - Create a new Data Source and choose the fetch method that matches your Ubicell data host (e.g., HTTP GET endpoint to Ubicquia cloud).
  - Map the required data fields in the Data Source to your TruContext form questions.
  - Schedule data fetching by setting an hourly, daily, or custom interval.[2]
  - Test the fetch to ensure real device data populates your TruContext forms, replacing any mock data.[2]

### Summary Steps

1. Physically install the Ubicell UGU units following the instructions.
2. Confirm Ubicell cloud connectivity and provision devices in Ubicquia’s platform.
3. Create or configure a Data Source in TruContext to integrate real-time metrics from Ubicell.
4. Map the device data to your forms and validate live data in the TruContext application.[4][2][3]

For step-by-step installation visuals, refer to Ubicquia’s NEMA installation video and check the user manual link included in your packaging or on ManualsLib.[1][3]
